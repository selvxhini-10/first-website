      The <b>hippopotamus</b>, also called <i>the hippo,</i>
      <u>common hippopotamus</u> or <mark>river hippopotamus,</mark> is a large,
      mostly herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal and ungulate native to
      <i>sub-Saharan Africaamus.</i>
      <br />It is one of only two extant species in the family
      <b>Hippopotamidae,</b> the other being the pygmy hippopotamus.

    <p>
      After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest
      type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl (in the
      traditional, non-cladistic sense of the term, not including cetaceans).
      <br />Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial
      even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae
      are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.), from which they
      diverged about 55 million years ago. <br />Hippos are recognisable by
      their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine
      tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults
      average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for males and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for females.
      <br />Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30
      km/h (19 mph) over short distances. Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and
      mangrove swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river
      and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos. <br />During the
      day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and
      birth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While
      hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity
      and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippo is among the most
      dangerous animals in the world due to its highly aggressive and
      unpredictable nature. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for
      their meat and ivory canine teeth.
